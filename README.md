# AWS EC2 Performance Scaling Architecture

## Overview
Optimized application performance by scaling Amazon EC2 instance capacity to meet workload demands while maintaining secure configuration and operational stability.

## Architecture Components
- Amazon EC2 instances with upgraded instance types  
- Security Groups for controlled network access  
- Monitoring metrics to evaluate performance improvements  

## Security & Performance Principles
- Secure scaling while maintaining least-privilege access  
- Performance optimization through right-sized resources  
- Reduced risk of service degradation during peak demand  
- Controlled access to prevent unnecessary exposure  

## Key Outcomes
- Improved application performance and responsiveness  
- Enhanced capacity planning to support workload growth  
- Maintained secure configuration during scaling operations  

## Technologies Used
- Amazon EC2  
- Security Groups  
- Cloud monitoring metrics  

## Status
Initial documentation. Enhancements and architecture diagrams coming.
